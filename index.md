Hi, i am Ollie North,
My name is Oliver North, but most people call me Ollie. I love football and playing videogames, but I also love music and I listen to mostly modern and alternative rock. At the weekends I work in Ralph Lauren, and I love my job. I have lived in Braintree, Essex for all my life other than when I lived in Spain for a couple of years. I am currently studying at the University of Essex where I am studying global studies with politics.
